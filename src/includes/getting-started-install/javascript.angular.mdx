<Alert level="info" title="Angular Version Compatibility" >

The latest version of the Sentry Angular SDK officially supports Angular 10 and newer.
If you are using an older Angular version and you experience problems with the SDK, you can
try using version 6 (at your own risk) until you upgrade your Angular version.
